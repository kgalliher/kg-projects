###kill-process-by-timespan
C# Windows form application that can be used in a scheduled task to check the duration of a running process and kill the process if necessary.

The form is a simple windows form with an image.  Instead of displaying text, the form uses the SpeechSynthesizer SpeakAsync function to convey the message.  Nothing says "I'm serious, get off the computer" like flashing 70's psychadelia and Steven Hawking's voice.
